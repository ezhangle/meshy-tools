To build, type "make off2noff" or "make noff2off" in this directory. These programs have been written and tested on OpenBSD/amd64, the compile with -Wall -pedantic and -ansi without any complaints so they should work fine on other platforms. Bug reports are welcome.




off2noff
--------
Converts (C)OFF files to (C)NOFF files by calculating the normal and barycentre (``centre of mass'') for each face. It then computes the normal of a vertex as a weighted sum of all adjacent face-normals. The weights are 1 / (1 + dist to barycentre ).




noff2off
--------
This simply reads a (C)NOFF file, writes the normal components to a file "normals", and outputs a plain (C)OFF file. The reading/writing of face data is performed blindly (i.e. as a stream of characters) and so CNOFF files may be converted to plain COFF files.
