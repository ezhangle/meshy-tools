OFFtools (v0.8) ---------------

These programs are release under a 2-clause BSD licence (see LICENCE),
but I'd appreciate it if you could drop me an email on
d.kaye@dunelm.org.uk and let me know if you find them useful.

To build, just type "make" in this directory.  These programs have been
written and (partially) tested on OpenBSD/amd64, the compile with using
GCC with -Wall -Wextra -pedantic and -std=c89 without any complaints so
they should work fine on other platforms.  Bug reports are welcome.

COFF and OFF files are both dealt with transparently, likewise CNOFF and
NOFF files.


add_normals -----------

Adds normal data to OFF and COFF files by calculating the normal and
barycentre (``centre of mass'') for each face.  It then computes the
normal of a vertex as a weighted sum of all adjacent face-normals.  The
weights are 1 / (1 + dist to barycentre ).

If a file of normal data is provided, this will be used instead of
calculating the normal information.


strip_normals -------------

Remove normals from OFF and COFF files and (optionally) dump them to an
external file.


add_colour ----------

Takes r,g and b values and applies this colour to all faces.  If a
colour file is provided, these will be provided.


strip_colour ------------

Remove colour data from a COFF or CNOFF file and (optionally) dump them
to an external file.

orient_norms -------------

Consistently orients the normals in a NOFF file.
