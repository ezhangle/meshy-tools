OFFtools (v0.7)
--------

These programs are release under a 2-clause BSD licence (see LICENCE),
but I'd appreciate it if you could drop me an email on
d.kaye@dunelm.org.uk and let me know if you find them useful.

To build, just type "make" in this directory. These programs have been
written and (partially) tested on OpenBSD/amd64, the compile with -Wall
-pedantic and -ansi without any complaints so they should work fine on
other platforms. Bug reports are welcome.

COFF and OFF files are both dealt with transparently, likewise CNOFF and
NOFF files. Whilst coff2off and noff2off dump the extra information to
an external file, which can be recombined later.


off2noff
--------
Converts OFF files to NOFF files by calculating the normal and
barycentre (``centre of mass'') for each face. It then computes the
normal of a vertex as a weighted sum of all adjacent face-normals. The
weights are 1 / (1 + dist to barycentre ).

If a file of normal data is provided, this will be used instead of
calculating the normal information.


noff2off
--------
Removes normals from a NOFF file and dumps them to an external file


off2coff
--------
Takes r,g and b values and applies this colour to all faces.

If a colour file is provided, it will apply these colours.


coff2off
--------
removes colours from a COFF file and dumps it to an external file
