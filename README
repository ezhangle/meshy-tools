OFFtools (v0.9) ---------------

These programs are release under a 2-clause BSD licence (see LICENCE),
but I'd appreciate it if you could drop me an email on
archibald@ethernull.org and let me know if you find them useful.

To build, just type "make" in this directory. These programs have been
written and (lightly) tested on OpenBSD, linux and Windows, the compile
using GCC with -Wall -Wextra -pedantic and -std=c89 without any
complaints so they should be fine on other platforms. 

COFF and OFF files are both dealt with transparently, likewise CNOFF and
NOFF files.

Known issues:
	- add_normals does not compute normals correctly.


------strip_normals------
Remove normals from NOFF and CNOFF files and (optionally) dump them to an
external file.

------add_normals------
Adds normal data to OFF and COFF files by calculating the normal and
barycentre (``centre of mass'') for each face. It then computes the
normal of a vertex as a weighted sum of all adjacent face-normals. The
weights are 1 / (1 + distance to barycentre).

If a file of per-vertex normal data is provided, these data will be
used instead of calculating the normal information.



------strip_colour------
Remove colour data from a COFF or CNOFF file and (optionally) dump them
to an external file.

------add_colour------
Takes r,g and b values and applies this colour to all faces.  If a
colour file produced by strip_colour is provided, these colours will be
used.
